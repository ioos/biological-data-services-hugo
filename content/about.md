It will save weeks to months of time acquiring, reformatting, understanding the collection techniques and conducting the analyses”_**

This document describes the data enrollment procedures proposed by IOOS Data Management and Communication (DMAC) to support sharing and integration of aquatic biological data (i.e. IOOS core variables: fish species, fish abundance, zooplankton species, zooplankton abundance, phytoplankton species). However these data services are applicable to any aquatic taxa that have presence, absence and abundance information.

The document encompasses the following major areas:

- IOOS basic principles for sharing ocean observing data.

- Biological data flow from IOOS Data providers through IOOS Regional Association to US IOOS DMAC system.

- The types of enrollment procedures and the steps of enrolling a data provider.
